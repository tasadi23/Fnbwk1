FNB App Academy Week 1
# 🚀 My Beginner Web Dev Journey: HTML & CSS

This is where my learning begins. I'm diving into how to build apps using **HTML**, and then making them look good with **CSS**. The idea is to start from scratch, really understand the basics, and come out of it with **two complete apps** that I built entirely on my own.

## 🧱 What This Part of the Journey Looks Like

First, it's all about **HTML** — how websites are structured, how content is laid out, and what each element does. Once I get the hang of that, I’ll move into **CSS**, which is where things start to look a lot more polished and visually interesting.

By the end of the FNB course, I’ll have built two apps from the ground up. Not just bits and pieces full, working apps that I created using everything I've learned.

## 📅 Week 1 – Getting Started with HTML

This week is all about the foundations. I’m focusing on learning how HTML works, what the different tags mean, and how they all come together to build a basic web page.

Here’s what I’ll be covering:

- **What HTML actually is**  
  Just getting familiar with the purpose of HTML and why it's the backbone of every web page.

- **The basic structure of a page**  
  Things like `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` — basically how to get a proper HTML page up and running.

- **Text elements**  
  Learning how to use headings, paragraphs, bold/italic text, and how to keep content organized.

- **Links and images**  
  Figuring out how to link to other pages and how to include images in the right way (not just throwing in a random `<img>` tag).

- **Lists and tables**  
  Getting the hang of bullet points, numbered lists, and simple tables to organize data.

- **A first look at forms**  
  Not diving too deep yet, but just enough to understand what forms do and how to create basic inputs and buttons.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

I'm taking my time with this, no rushing. The goal isn’t just to “get through it” but to really understand how each part works. Every line of code is a step closer to being able to build real apps from scratch, and that’s what makes this exciting.
